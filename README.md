# Σ Toolbox (Sigma Toolbox)

A TurboWarp custom extension that adds a custom variable system with `eval`, math expressions, types, and advanced variable manipulation.  
Great for scripting inside TurboWarp.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/).
2. Click the bottom left button (that has like a 2 blocks and a "+" sign) → **"Add Extension"** → **"Custom Extension"**.
3. You can load it two ways:
   - **By URL** → paste this link:  
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ch3rryC0d3r/SigmaToolbox/main/SigmaToolbox.js
     ```
   - **By Text** → copy the contents of `SigmaToolbox.js` and paste them directly into the box.
4. That’s all ✅ If you have any feedback, just tell me!
